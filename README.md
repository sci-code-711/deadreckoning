# deadreckoning
Masters project AO35: "Trajectory reconstruction using Inertial Motion Units (IMUs) and the implications for Aerobots on Venus." 

Supervised by: Colin Wilson, University of Oxford, AOPP department.

Included are:
3 working copys of the deadreckoning code used during this project 
- "Deadreckoning.py"
- "EKF.py"
- "EKF_fut.py"
with a working control space that intergrates data processing capabilities "~Deadreckoning_interface.ipynb"
along with a set of example data "example_data.csv".

Additonaly an implementation of a multi positional calibration procedure for a 6 axis IMU. "~calibartion_notebook.ipynb"

The research was completed using a 6 axis LSM6SD3 embedded on a Arduino 33Iot board.
